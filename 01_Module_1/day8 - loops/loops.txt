Python Loops: Day 9

what we'll cover:
1. what is loop?
2. The for loop
3. The while loop
4. Looping over lists, strings, and ranges
5. Practice exercises + mini Challenge

1. What is a loop?
A loop lets us repeat a block of code multiple times.

There are two main types:
-for loops- used when you know how many times to repeat
-while loops- used when the repetition depends on a condition.

2. for loop Basics
-Loop over a list:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

output: 
apple
banana
cherry

-loop using range()
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
output:
0
1
2

4

-loop with custom start and step:
for i in range(1, 11, 2):#start=1, stop=11, step=2
    print(i)
output:
1

Practice: for loop
try writing these:
1. print numbers from 1 to 10.
2. print square of numbers from 1 to 5.
3. Print each letter in the word "Python".

3. While Loop Basics
-basic while loop
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count+=1

output
1

Practice: while loop
1. print numbers from 10 to 1 using while 
2. ask the user to guess a number until they get it right.

Challenge Time!
challenge1: Countdown
wap that counts down from 10 to 1 using loop, and Then
prints "Blast Off!".

challenge2: sum of First N numbers
Take input from the user and find the sum of numbers from 1 
to that number using a loop
