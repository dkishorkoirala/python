what is dictionary?
- a dictionary is like a real-life dictionary: it maps a word(key) to its definition(value).
python
student = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 20,
    "grade": "A"
}

in this example
"name", "age", "grade" are keys
"John", 20, "A" are values 

accessing values
direct access:
print(student["name"]) #output = John

safe access:
print(student.get("name")) #output = John
print(student.get("Address", "Not found")) #output = not found
safer than
print(student["Address"])


looping over a dictionary
-loop over keys only: student is key here
for student in students:
    print(student, students[student])

loop over key-value pairs: student is key and info is value
for student, info in students.items():
    print(f"{student} = {info}")

try yourself

task: loop through this dictionary and print in the format "key": "value"
book ={
    "title": "ai for beginners",
    "author": "Dibash",
    "pages": 300
}
expected output
