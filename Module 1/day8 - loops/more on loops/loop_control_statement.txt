What we'll cover:
break: stop a loop early
continue: skip the current iteration
else with loops
nested loops
practice exercises and challenge

1. break- Exit the loop immediately
for i in range (1, 10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)

output
1
2
3
4

as soon as i == 5 the loop breaks and stops.

2. continue - skip the round , go to the next
python;
for i in range (1,6):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
output
1
2
4
5
It skips 3 but keeps running the rest.

3. else with loops
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
else: 
    print("Loop completed")

output
0
1
2
3
4
Loop completed

Runs the else only if loop didn't break early.

for i in range(5):
    if i ==2 :
        break
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop completed")

output
0
1

Nested loops (loop inside loop)
for i in range(1,4):
    for j in range(1,4):
        print(i,j)

output
1 1
1 2
1 3
2 1
2 2
2 3
3 1
3 2
3 3

Great for working with grids, matrices or combinations.

practice tasks
1. Break task:
Keep taking input until user types "stop", then exit.
2. Continue Task:
Print numbers 1 to 10, skip even numbers.

3. Else with loop:
Loop 5 times and print "Loop ended properly" using else.

4. Nested loop:
Print a multiplication table (1–5):

1x1=1 1x2=2 ...
2x1=2 2x2=4 ...

Challenge: Password Checker
Ask the user for password up to 3 times:

If correct → print “Access granted”

If 3 wrong tries → print “Access denied”
