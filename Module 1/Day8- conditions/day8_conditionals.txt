Day 8: Control Flow: if,elif, else in python

we will cover:
-what conditional statements are
-how to use if, elif, and else
-comparision and logical operators
-real-life examples using conditions

concept 1: the if Statement

age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")

if the condition is true, it executes the indented block below it

Concept 2 : The if...else statement
age = 16
if age >=18:
    print("You can vote.")
else:
    print("You are too young to vote.")

else is executed only when the if condition is False.

Concept 3: the if...elif....else chain

marks = 75

if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade A")
elif marks >=80:
    print("Grade B")
elif marks >= 70:
    print("Grade C")
else:
    print("Grade F")

Python checks conditions top to bottom until one is true. Then it stops checking.

Comparison Operators
operator                operation           example
==                      equal to            a == b
!=                      not equal to        a != b
>                       grater than         a > b
<                       less than           a < b
>=                      grater or equal     a >= b
<=                      less or equal       a <= b

Logical operators
operator                Description                     example
and             all condtionons must be true            a > 0 and a <100
or              at least one condition must be true     a > 0 or a > 100
not             Inverts the condition                   not (a == b)

Practice examples
1 example 1: odd or even
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if num % 2 == 0:
    print("The number is even.")
else:
    print("The number is odd.")

example 2 : simple login system
username = input("Enter username: ")
password = input("Enter password: ")

if username == "admin" and password == "1234":
    print("Login Successfull!")
else:
    print("Invalid Credentials")

Task:
1. Age group classifier
    input age from user
    print "child" if < 13, "teenager" if < 20, else "adult"
2. Voter eligiblity checker
    input age and citizenship
    must be 18+ and citizen = "yes" to vote
3. Simple calculator using conditions
    Ask user to input two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /).
    perform calculation based on the operator

Challenge: student Grader
wap that takes a student's name and score as input.
-print:
    A for 90+
    B for 80-89
    C for 70-79
    F below 70
        also print "Topper" if the score is exact 100.
