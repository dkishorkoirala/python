Day 2 : Python operators and expressions

we will cover:
-arithmetic operators
-comparison (relational) operators
-assignment operators
-logical operators
-practice exercises
-Mini project and day 2 challenges

1. Arithmetic Operators

operators -> Descriptions -> example -> output
+         -> addition      -> 5 + 1  -> 6
-         -> subtraction   -> 5 - 1  -> 4
*         -> Multiplication-> 5 * 2  -> 10
/         -> Division(float)-> 5/2 ->2.5
//        ->Floor Division -> 5 // 2 -> 2
%         ->Modulus(Remainder)-> 5 % 2 ->1
**        -> Exponentiation  -> 5 ** 2 -> 25

2. Comparison Operators

operator-> Description -> Example -> output
==      -> Equal to    -> 5 == 5 -> True
!=      -> not equal to-> 5 != 5 -> False
>       -> Greater than -> 5 > 2 -> True
<       -> Less than    -> 5 > 2 -> False
>=      -> Greater or equal -> 5 >= 5 ->True
<=      -> Less or equal  -> 5 <= 3   -> False

3. Assignment Operators

x = 10   #assign
x += 5   #add and assign x = x + 5 -> 15
x -= 2   #subtract and assign x = x - 2 -> 13
x *= 5   #multiply and assign x = x * 5 -> 65
x /= 5   #divide and assign x = x / 5 -> 13.0
x %= 4   #Modulus and assign x = x % 4 -> 1
x **= 2  #Exponentiation and assign x = x ** 2 -> 1

4. Logical Operators

a = True
b = False

print(a and b) #False
print(a or b)  #True
print(not a)   #False

practice exercises
Task 1: Arithmetic practice
Input 2 numbers and show:
-sum
-difference
-product
-Remainder
- power

Task 2: Comparison tester
Input 2 numbers and show:
-is first grater than second ?
- are they equal?
- is first less than or equal to second?

Task 3: Logic tester
Input:
- a user's age 
- is the user above 18 and below 60? (Eligible adult?)
- is the user a minor or a Senior?

Mini projects for day 2
1. Even or odd checker
-input a number and chek if it's even or odd using Modulus %.

2. Grading System
-input marks and print Grade:
- 90 + -> A 
- 80 - 89 -> B 
- 70 - 79 -> C 
- below 70 -> D 

3. Salary Bonus calculator
- input basic Salary
- add 10 % bonus if salary < 50,000.
- else , add 5 % bonus .
- print updated salary

Challenge of the day: Simple logic Gate simulator
- input two binary values ( 0 or 1)
-print:
    and 
    or
    not (first value only)
