Part1 : Tuples in python
-A tuple is like a list, but immutable(you can't change it after creation.)
-tuples are defined with parentheses () instead of square brackets.

my_tuples = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(my_tuples[0]) # prints: apple

-why use tuples?
-more secure than lists(can't be accidentally changed).
-often used for fixed collections like coordinates, dates, etc

part2: Sets in python
-what is a set?
-a set is a collection of unique items, defined with curly braces{}
-sets are unordered and don't allow duplicates.

my_set = {"apple", "apple" , "banana", "cherry"} # duplicates are ignored
print(my_set)   #output: {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}

-why use sets?
-super useful for checkign membership, removing duplicates and doing set operations
like union, intersection, etc

common tuple methods
>>> t = (10, 20, 30, 40)
>>> print(len(t))
4
>>> print(t.count(20))
1
>>> print(t.index(30))
2

Common set methods
s1 = {1, 2, 3}
s2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}

print(s1.union(s2)) #{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
print(s1.intersection(s2))     #{3}
print(s1.difference(s2))    #{1, 2}

Practice exercises(do these after learning)
1. create a tuple of 5 fruits and print the second fruit
2. try changing one value in a tuple and see what error you get
3. count how many times a value apperars in a tuple
4. create a set of 5 colors.
5. add a new color to your set
6. try adding a duplicate and print the set
7. remove one color to your set
8. create two sets and print their union
9. Find the intersection of two sets.
10. Print the difference between two sets.

mini challenge of the day:
student attendance checker.
-take input from user for 5 student names and store in a set.
-then ask the user to input a name to check attendance
-print whether the student is present or not.
