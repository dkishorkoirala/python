Day 43 Practice: Class variables vs instance variables 

recap (very short)

type                belongs to               stored in          accessed by
instance variables  one object only         self.<name>         obj.name
class variables     shared by all           ClassName.<name>     ClassName.name || obj.name

mini task(5 practice tasks)

task1: Count employees
Create a class employee that track of how many total employees were 
created using a class variable total_employee

e1 = Employee("Kiran")
e2 = Employee("Sita")
e3 = Employee("Hari")
print(Employee.total_employees)

Task2: Ticket ID Generator
Create a Ticket class where each ticket is assigned a unique ID using a 
class variable ticket_id_counter.
Each instance stores its own ID as instance variable id.

t1 = Ticket()
t2 = Ticket()
t3 = Ticket()
print(t1.id)   # 1
print(t2.id)   # 2
print(t3.id)   # 3

Task 3: track All book titles (shared list)
create a library class. Each book instance has title and author.
All book titles are stored in a shared class variable list: all_titles.

b1 = Library("Gita", "Vyasa")
b2 = Library("Ramayana", "Valmiki")
print(Library.all_titles) 

Task4: Shared discount for all products
create a products class with name, price, and a class variable discount=
0.1
Define a method get_final_price() that returns price after discount.

p1 = Product("Laptop", 50000)
print(p1.get_final_price())  # 45000.0

Product.discount = 0.2       # Update discount
print(p1.get_final_price()) 

Task 5: create a cap on Students(like yesterday)
only 3 Students allowed using a class variable. Print a warning if a fourth is added.

s1 = Student("A")
s2 = Student("B")
s3 = Student("C")
s4 = Student("D")


Challenge Time
Challenge: Bank Account with shared Interest Rate

create a class BankAccount with:
-instance variable: name, balance
-class variable: interest_rate (eg. 0.05)
-Method calculate_interest() that returns interest based on current balance
-method Update_rate(new_rate) that updates interest for all accounts
(modify class var)

a1 = BankAccount("Ram", 100000)
a2 = BankAccount("Sita", 200000)

print(a1.calculate_interest())  # 5000
print(a2.calculate_interest())  # 10000

BankAccount.update_rate(0.1)
print(a1.calculate_interest())  # 10000
print(a2.calculate_interest())
