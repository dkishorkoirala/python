Day 79: Matrix Operations

What will we cover:
1. Identity Matrix : what it is and why it matters.
2. Diagonal Matrix: Definition and usage.
3. Trace of a Matrix: How to compute it and what it tells us.
4. Rank of a Matrix: what rank means in linear algebra and why it's powerful.
- practice tasks.
- A final challenge problem.

1. Identity matrix
- A square matrix where all Diagonal elements are 1, and all off-Diagonal elements are 0.

I = [[1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1]]

- Property:
    - Multiplying any matrix by I leaves it unchanged.
    - A x I = I x A = A.

code:
import numpy as np

I = np.identity(3)
print("3x3 Identity martix:\n", I)

A = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
I2 = np.identity(2)

print("\nMatrix A:\n", A)
print("\nA x I2:\n", A @ I2) #same as A 

2. Diagonal Matrix
- A  matrix with all non-Diagonal elements = 0.

D = [[5,0,0],
     [0,7,0],
     [0,0,2]]

- Diagonal matrices are useful in simplifying matrix operations.

code:
D = np.diag([5,7,2])
print("Diagonal Matrix:\n", D)
print("\nExtracted Diagonal elements:\n", np.diag(D))

3. Trace of a Matrix
- the sum of diagonal elements of a square matrix.
trace(A) = i∑​aii​

- property:
    - Trace is invariant under transpose (trace(A)= trace(A^T))
    - in linear algebra, trace has connections with eigenvalues (sum of eigenvalues = trace)

code:
A = np.array([[3,4,5],[1,2,7],[6,8,9]])

print("Matrix A:\n", A)
print("\nTrace of A:\n", np.trace(A))

4. Rank of a Matrix
- Rank = number of linearly independent rows/columns
- intutively: It tells how much "information" is in the matrix.
    - Full rank -> no redundancy
    - Lower rank -> some rows/columns are combinations of others.

code:
A = np.array([[2,4],[1,2]])

print("Matrix A:\n",A)
print("\nRank of A:", np.linalg.martix_rank(A))

- here, rank = 1 beacuse the second row is just half of the first -> not independent.

Mini tasks:
Task1: 
create a 4x4 identity matrix and multiply it with a custom 4x4 matrix. Verify that the result 
is the same as the original matrix.

Task2:
Extract the diagonal elements of the matrix and compute its trace:
B = [[4,1,0],
     [0,5,2],
     [7,0,6]]

Task3:
Find the rank of 
C = [[2,3],[4,6]]

Challenge project:
Given a matrix

M = [[1,2,3],
     [4,5,6],
     [7,8,9]]

1. find the trace
2. find its rank.
3. create a diagonal martix using the diagonal elements of M.
4. Multiply M with that diagonal matrix.
