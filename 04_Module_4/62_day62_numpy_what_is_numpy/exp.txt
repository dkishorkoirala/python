Day 62: Numpy Basics - What is Numpy & Arrays

what we'll cover:
- why numpy is so powerful compared to normal python lists
- installing and importing Numpy
- creating our first Numpy array.
- Key differences between Python lists and Numpy Arrays

concept: What is Numpy?
Numpy (Numerical Python) is a python library built for fast Numerical computations.
- Think of NumPy array as super-efficient python lists.
- They are used for machine learning, AI, data analysis, scientific computing.
- They can handle large datasets and perform calculations hundreds of times faster than normal lists.

NumPy is the foundation for:
- Pandas (Data analysis)
- TensorFlow & PyTorch (Deep learning)
- SciPy & Scikti-learn (scientific computing and machine learning)

Python List vs Numpy array

ex: python lists
my_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(my_list * 2)

#output : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

ex: Numpy array

import numpy as np 

my_array = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
print(my_array * 2)

# output: [2 4 6 8 10]

key differences:
list: repeat elements
Array: perform mathematical operations element-wise

** installing and importing NumPy

if not installed:
pip install numpy

in python, always import like this:
import numpy as np

(everyone in the python world uses np as the short form!)

## Creating our first Numpy array

import numpy as np

my_array = np.array([10,20,30,40,50])

print(my_array)     # [10 20 30 40 50]
print(type(my_array)) # <class 'numpy.ndarray'>

Notice: NumPy arrays are of type numpy.ndarray
(nd= n-dimensional, meaning they can be 1D, 2D, 3D, etc)

Mini tasks
1. Create a NumPy array from the list [5, 10, 15, 20,25] and print it.
2. check the type of that object (sould be numpy.ndarray)
3. Multiply every element of [1,2,3,4,5] by 3 using:
    - a normal python list ( with a loop or list comprehension).
    - A NumPy array. Compare results.

challenge Day:
problem: 
write a program that:
1. Takes a list [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].
2. Converts it into a Numpy array.
3. Multiplies the entire array by 5 in one line.
4. Prints both the original list and the new NumPy array result.
