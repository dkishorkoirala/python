Day 71 â€“ Axis-Based Operations (row-wise, col-wise calculations)

what will we cover:
- what does "axis" mean in numpy?
- difference between axis=0 and axis=1
- performing row-wise and column-wise calculations (sum, mean, etc)
- real-world intuition with examples
- practice task + final challenge

1. what is an axis?
- think of a NumPy array like a table (matrix):
      col0 col1 col2
Row0    1   2   3
Row1    4   5   6
Row2    7   8   9

- axis = 0 -> column-wise (down the rows)
   - moves vertically | 
   - so operations are applied column by column 

- axis = 1 -> row-wise (across the columns)
   - moves horizontally ---
   - so operations are applied row by row

another way to remember
- axis = 0 -> collapse rows, keep columns
- axis = 1 -> collapse columns, keep rows

example in code:

import numpy as np 

arr = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])

print("Original array:\n", arr)
print("Column-wise sum:\n", np.sum(arr, axis = 0))
print("Row-wise sum:\n", np.sum(arr, axis = 1))
print("Column-wise mean:\n", np.mean(arr, axis = 0))
print("Row-wise mean:\n", np.mean(arr, axis = 1))

3. Real life example(student marks)
imagine rows = student, columns = subjects

marks = np.array([
    [78, 85, 92],
    [60, 72, 80],
    [90, 95, 100]
])
print("Row-wise(student avg):\n", np.mean(marks, axis = 1))
print("Column-wise(Subject avg):\n", np.mean(marks, axis = 0))

Mini tasks:
task1: 
create a 3x4 array of numbers from 1 to 12
- find row-wise sum
- find column-wise mean

task2:
given:
arr = np.array([[2, 7, 3],
                [5, 1, 9],
                [8, 6, 4]])

- find row-wise min values
- find column-wise max values

task3:
generate 4x5 random array between 1-50
- compute row-wise standard deviation (std)
- compute column-wise variance (var)

challenge project:
we have a dataset representing sales (rows=months, columns = products):
sales = np.array([
    [200, 300, 250, 400],
    [150, 220, 300, 310],
    [400, 500, 450, 600],
    [100, 150, 200, 180]
])

find:
1. Total sales per product (column-wise sum)
2. Average sales per month (row-wise mean)
3. Which product had the maximum overall sales?
4. Which month had the lowest total sales?
