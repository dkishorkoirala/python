Day 76: Stacking & Splitting Arrays

what will we cover:
- The difference between stacking and Splitting 
- functions: np.hstack(), np.vstack()
- functions: np.split(), np.hsplit(), np.vsplit()
- practical examples combining arrays horizontally & vertically
- Splitting arrays into equal-sized chunks or custom sections

1. What is Stacking?
Stacking means joining arrays together along an axis
- horizontal stacking (hstack)-> joins arrays side by side (along columns).
- vertical stacking (vstack)-> joins arrays on top of each other (along rows).

Think of it like arranging lego blocks:
- hstack = place blocks left and right.
- vstack = place blocks on top of each other.

ex:
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1,2,3])
b = np.array([4,5,6])

print("horizontal stack:", np.hstack((a,b)))
print("vertical stack:\n", np.vstack((a,b)))

output:
horizontal stack: [1 2 3 4 5 6]
vertical stack: 
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]

2. what is spliting?
Splitting means breaking arrays into smaller sub-arrays.

- np.split() -> general splitting along any axis.
- np.hsplit() -> horizontal split (columns)
- np.vsplit()-> vertical split (rows)

think of it like cutting a chocolate bar into smaller pieces.

ex:
x = np.array([[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8]])

#split into 2 equal parts (by columns)
print("hsplit:\n", np.hsplit(x,2))

#split into 2 equal parts (by rows)
print("vsplit:\n",np.vsplit(x,2))

output
hsplit:
 [array([[1, 2],
       [5, 6]]), array([[3, 4],
       [7, 8]])]
vsplit:
 [array([[1, 2, 3, 4]]), array([[5, 6, 7, 8]])]

Mini tasks:
Task1:
create two arrays:
a = [1,2,3]
b = [4,5,6]

- horizontally stack them
- vertically stack them

Task2:
Make a 2D array:
x = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8]]

- split it into 2 parts columns-wise(hsplit)
- split it into 2 parts rows-wise(vsplit)

Task 3:
create a 1D array of numbers from 0 to 15
- split it into 4 equal sub-arrays using np.split()

Challenge Project:
Matrix organizer:
1. create a 6x4 matrix filled with numbers from 1 to 24
2. Split it into 3 equal parts row-wise (each part should be 2×4).
3. Split it into 2 equal parts column-wise (each part should be 6×2).
4. Then, vertically stack the first two row parts back together.
5. Finally, horizontally stack the two column parts back together.
