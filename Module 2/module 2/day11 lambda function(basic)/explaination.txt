Day 11: Lambda function(basic level)

we'll cover:
what is lambda function in python?
how to write and use lambda fucntions.
differences between lambda fucntions and regular fucntions
simple practical examples

Quick intro:
a lambda function is a small anonumous function- meaning it doesn't 
need a name. It's useful when we need a quick function for a short task,
usually in one line.

syntax:
lambda arguments: expression

ex:
add = lambda x, y : x + y
print(add(3, 4))

why use lambda?
handy for short, simple functions
often used in function like map(), filter(), and sorted() where we need a small function as an argument.
keeps our code concise.

mini Task(practice):
create a lambda function that:
1. takes a number and returns its square
2. takes two numbers and returns their products

more:

Check Even or Odd
Write a lambda function that takes a number and returns "Even" if the number is even, else "Odd".

Sort List of Tuples by Second Element
Given a list of tuples like [(1, 3), (2, 1), (4, 2)], use a lambda function to sort the list based on the second element of each tuple.

Bonus Challenge 1: Maximum of Three Numbers
Write a lambda function that takes three numbers and returns the largest.

Bonus Challenge 2: Check if Year is Leap Year
Use a lambda function to check if a year is a leap year.
A leap year is:
Divisible by 4 and
Not divisible by 100 unless also divisible by 400
