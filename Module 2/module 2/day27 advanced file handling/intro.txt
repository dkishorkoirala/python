Day 27: Advanced file handling

what we will cover:
1. checking if a file exists (using os.path.exists)
2. reading files line by line (readline(), readlines())
3. writing multiple lines (writelines())
4. working with file paths using the os module
5. Multiple mini tasks and a final challenge

1. checking if a file exists
sometimes, opening a file that doesn't exist crashes your program. Use this:
import os

if os.path.exist("diary.txt"):
    print("file exists!!")
else: 
    print("File doesn't exists")

2. Reading line by line
using readline():

file = open("diary.txt", "r")
print(file.readline())      #reads one line at a time
file.close()

using readlines()

file = open("diary.txt", "r")
lines = file.readline()      #returns a list of all lines
for line in lines:
    print(line.strip())
file.close()

3. Writing multiple lines
you can write a list of lines at once using writelines():

lines = ["first line\n","second line\n", "third line\n"]
file = open("log.txt","w")
file.writelines(lines)
file.close()

#be careful: writinglines() won't add \n automatically

4. File paths with os module

import os

#get current working directory
print(os.getcwd())

#join paths correctly (cross-platform safe)
filepath = os.path.join("data", "log.txt")
print(filepath)

Mini Task 1: Check File
Write a program to check if "notes.txt" exists or not.

Mini Task 2: Show All Lines
Read all lines of "diary.txt" using readlines() and print each line with line number.

Mini Task 3: Save a List
Ask the user to enter 3 favorite movies, store them in a list, and save them to "movies.txt" using writelines().

Challenge Project: Daily Logger
Build a program to:
Check if daily_log.txt exists.
If not, create it.
-Ask user to input a message.
-Save the message with todayâ€™s date (hint: use datetime.now()).
-Append it to the file.
