Challenge 1: Expense Tracker (Modular Style)

Create a simple expense tracker using two files:

tracker.py â€” (your module)
Function: add_expense(amount, category)
Function: show_expenses()
Internally store expenses in a list of dictionaries like:
[{"amount": 500, "category": "Food"}, {"amount": 200, "category": "Transport"}]

main.py
Import the module
Ask the user:
a. To add expenses (amount + category)
b. To view all expenses
Loop until user exits

Bonus: Let the user see the total amount spent so far.
