Day 12: lambda with built-in functions (level intermediate)
we 'll cover 
1. using lambda with:
sorted()- custom sorting (like sorting tuples or dictionaries)
max() and min() - with key functions

2. common use-cases:
    sorting by second item in a tuple
    sorting dictionary values
    finding longest string or highest value from a list of dicts/tuples
3. Practice tasks and 5 new challenges

Topic 1: Using lambda with sorted()
what is sorted()?
sorted() is a built-in functions that returns a new sorted list from the
elements of any iterable (like list, tuple, etc)

it takes an optional argument called key - which can be a lambda function
- to decide how to sort

Basic syntax:
sorted(iterable, key = lambda item:some-rule)

ex1: sort a list of tuples by the second item
pair = [(1,3) , (2,1), (4,2)]

#sort by second item in each tuple
sorted_pairs = sorted(pairs, key = lambda x:x[1])
print(sorted_pairs)

lambda x:x[1] means : for each tuple x, use the second item (x[1])
to sort

ex.2: sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key

students = [
    {"name":"alice", "score":88 },
    {"name":"bob", "score": 75},
    {"name": "charlie", "score":95}
]

sorted_students = sorted(students, key = lambda student: student['score'])
print(sorted_students)

mini Practice tasks
1. sort this list of tuples by first item:
pairs = [(3,4),(1,2),(5,0)]

2. sort this list of names by their length:
names=["sam", "Elizabeth", "Jo", "Charles"]

3. sort a list of dictionaries by age:
people = [
    {"name" :"Tom", "age" : 32},
    {"name": "jerry","age": 25},
    {"name": "spike","age": 40}
]

bonus:
You have a list of students, where each student is represented as a dictionary
 with a name and a list of their scores.

students = [
    {"name": "Alice", "scores": [85, 90, 78]},
    {"name": "Bob", "scores": [70, 88, 95]},
    {"name": "Charlie", "scores": [90, 92, 85]},
]
Task:
Use sorted() with a lambda to sort the students by their average score 
(ascending order).

bonus 2:
Sort the students by their highest individual score, not the average.
students = [
    {"name": "Alice", "scores": [85, 90, 78]},
    {"name": "Bob", "scores": [70, 88, 95]},
    {"name": "Charlie", "scores": [90, 92, 85]},
]
Use sorted() and a lambda function to sort this list by the maximum score in 
each student's scores list.
