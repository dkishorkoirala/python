day 1: intro to function:
we'll cover:
what a function is
why function are useful
how to define and call a basic function in python

funtion is like  a mini-program inside our program. It helps us:
-avoid repeating code
-break big tasks into smaller, manageable parts
-make your code look clean and smart( like a code ninja)

imagine a blender: you just press the button and it makes a smoothie.
you don't care how it works inside. That's what a function is in code!

how to write a function in python
def greet():
    print("Hello, welcome to python")

breakdown:
def- tells python you're defining a function
greet- name of your function(like naming a pet)
()- holds input(we'll do that later)
: means "now the function starts"
print()- this is what the function does

how to call (use ) the function
once defined, you must call it to make it run:

greet()

if you don't call it python won't run it!

mini task:
create a function called hello_friend that prints:

hello friend, have a good day!

and call it

Daily challenge
1. say _hello()-> print "Hello!"
2. say_goodbye()-> prints "See you!"
daily_motivation()-> prints"Keep going, you're doing great!"

then call them all, one after another
