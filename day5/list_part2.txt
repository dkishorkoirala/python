Day 5: lists (part2)= Advanced operations 
what will we learn:
-sorting and reversing lists
-copying lists  properly
-using min() , max(), sum() on number lists
-nesting lists
-List comprehension( intro)

1. sorting and reversing lists

fruits =[ "banana", "apple", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]
fruits. sort() #sorts alphabetically
print (fruits) #prints the sorted list

fruits. reverse() #reverses the list
print (fruits) #prints the reversed list

2. Copuing lists correctly
a = [1,2,3]
b = a.copy()
b. append(4)

print ("original:", a) #prints [1,2,3]
print("copied:",b ) #prints [1,2,3,4]

3. Working with number lists

numbers=[4, 8, 2, 7]
print("Min:", min(numbers))
print("Max:", max(numbers))
print("Sum:", sum(numbers))

4. Nested lists(2d lists)
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6]
]

print(matrix[1][2]) #prints 6

5.List comprehension (intro)

squares = [ x ** 2 for x in range (5)]
print(squares) #prints [0,1,4,9,16]

Practice exercises:
1. create a list of 5 numbers, print the max, min, and sum.
2. create a 2d list for student scores(2 students, 3 scores each). print second 
student's scores
3. sort a list of fruits alphabetically and reverse it.
4. copy a list of colors and show that the copy is different from the original.
5. use list comprehension to create a list of even numbers form 0 to 10
6. take 3 input from the  user and store each in a list: name , age , and city.
7. given a list of numbers, create a new list with only the squares of odd numbers.
8. Create a grocery list and sort it in reverse alphabetical order.
9. Create a list of temperatures and print the average.
10. Create a list of strings and make a new list of all strings longer than 3 characters.
