What is dictionary?
a dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs.
It's like a real dictionary: you loop up a word(key) and get a meaning(value).

student = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 20,
    "grade": "A"
}

Basic Operations
1. create and access
person = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 20
}
print(person["name"])
#output : John

2. Add or update value

person["city"] = "kathmandu"
perosn["age"] = 26

3. remove a key

del person["city"]

4. Looping through Dictionary
for key, value in perosn.items():
    print(key, ":" , ,value)

#output: name: John, age: 26

Practice exercises
Task1: create a dictionary of a student with name, age, and grade. print it.
task2: access and print the student's grade.
task3: update the student's grade to "A+"
task4: add a new key "school" with value "XYZ school".
task5: remove the key "Age" from the dictionary.
task6: print all key using a loop.
task7: print all values using a loop.
task 8: create a dictionary of 3 friends and their favourite colors.
        loop through and print each one.
task9: use .get() to safely access a key that may not exist.
print(person.get("hobby", "not found"))

task10: nesting - create a dictionary with 2 students and their subject scores as a nested dictionary.

Mini- challenge:
student management system:
wap that:
    - takes input for 3 students: name, age, and score
    - store them in a dictionary where the name is the key and the value is another dictionary with age and score.
    - prints the complete dictionary
    - prints each student's name and their score
