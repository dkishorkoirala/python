Day 12 - Final Challenge Project: Student Report Generator
What you’ll build:
A program that takes a list of students (with their names and scores), and:
Calculates each student’s average score.

Finds:
Topper (highest average)
Student with the lowest average
Student with the highest minimum score

Sorts the students:
By average score
By highest individual score
Formats and displays everything cleanly.

Starter Data:
students = [
    {"name": "Alice", "scores": [85, 90, 78]},
    {"name": "Bob", "scores": [70, 88, 95]},
    {"name": "Charlie", "scores": [90, 92, 85]},
    {"name": "David", "scores": [80, 82, 84]}
]
Your Tasks:
Step 1: Add average score to each student
Use map() and lambda.

Step 2: Find:
Topper (highest average score)
Student with lowest average
Student with highest minimum score (safest performer)
Use max() / min() with key= and lambda.

Step 3: Sort students
By average score (ascending)
By highest individual score (descending)
Use sorted() and lambda.

Step 4: Print nicely
Display results like:

Topper: Charlie with average 89.0
Lowest Scorer: Bob with average 84.33
Most consistent performer (best lowest score): Charlie with min score 85

Sorted by average score:
Alice - 84.33
Bob - 84.33
David - 82.0
Charlie - 89.0

Sorted by highest score:
Bob - 95
Charlie - 92
Alice - 90
David - 84
