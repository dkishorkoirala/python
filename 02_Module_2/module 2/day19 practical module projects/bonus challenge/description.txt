Bonus Challenge: word frequency counter

objective:
we'll create a module to analyze word frequency from a given sentence

Step1: create a file called word_status.py
inside it :
def word_count(text):
    #accept a string
    #returns a dictionary where keys are words and values are their frequency

ex:
input: "apple banana apple orange banana apple"
output:{"apple": 3, "banana": 2, "orange": 1}

step 2: create main.py
it should :
1. ask user to enter a sentence
2. use word_count() to compute the frequencies
3. print them in a readable way

expected output
enter text: Python is great and python is easy
word frequencies:
python- 2
is - 2
great -1
and - 1
easy - 1
