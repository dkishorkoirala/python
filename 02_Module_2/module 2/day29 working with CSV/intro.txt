Day 29: Working with CSV files.
-reading and writing CSV(Comma Seperated Values) files using python built-in CSV module

what is CSV file?
A CSV file is like a simple spreadsheet- it stores tabular data (rows and 
columns), where each row is a list, and columns are Seperated by commas.

ex content of a students.csv :
Name,Age,Grade
Ram,15,A 
shyam,16,B 
Hari,15,C 

python has a module called CSV to help us easily read and write these files

step-by-step concepts
1. importing the csv module
import csv 

2. writing to a csv file (row by row)
import csv

with open("students.csv","w", newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["Name","Age","Grade"])
    writer.writerow(["Ram",15,"A"])
    writer.writerow(["Shyam",16,"B"])

use newline='' to avoid empty lines on windows.

3. Reading a csv file
import csv

with open("student.csv","r") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)

output will be lists:
["Name","Age","Grade"]
["Ram",15,"A"]
["Shyam",16,"B"]

4. Writing multiple rows at once
rows = [
    ["Name","Age","Grade"],
    ["Hari",15,"A"],
    ["Gita",17,"B"]
]

with open("students.csv","w","newline='') as f:
    writer= csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerows(rows)
