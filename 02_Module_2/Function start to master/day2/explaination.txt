Day 2: return Vs Print + function Inputs:
what you'll learn today:
the difference between print() and return
how to pass inputs into function (parameters)
why return makes dunctions reusable in AI and logic

print() vs return- what's the difference?

def greet():
    return "Hello, My student!"

message = greet()
print(message)  # prints: Hello, My student!

return sends a value back to the caller, which can be stored, modified, or passed again

print() only shows the output- it doesn't return anything you can reuse 

saying:
print() is for display, return is for power and reuse

function inputs (parameters)
you can send data into a function like this:
def greet(name):
    return f"Namaste, {name}!"

print(greet("Dibash")) # prints: Namaste, Dibash!

you can give one, two or many inputs:
def add(a, b):
    return a + b 

result = add (10 , 5)
print(result) # prints: 15

your mini task:
Define a function square (num) that returns the square of a number.

print(square(3))

daily challenge:
build a motivation generator that:
takes your name as input( like motivate ("Dibash"))
return a personalized message like:
    keep going, kishor! you are doing great!

use return, not print() inside the function
