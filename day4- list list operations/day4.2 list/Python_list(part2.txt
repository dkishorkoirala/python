we will cover:
-how to use lists with logic(if, loops)
-sorting and reversing lists
-checking membership
-copying lists
-working with nested lists(intro)

Practice exercises(10 Tasks)
1. check if item exists
ask the user to enter a fruit and check if it's in your perdefined fruit list.

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "Orange", "grape", "mango"]
user_fruit = input("Enter a fruit name: ")
if user_fruit.lower() in fruits:
    print("Yes, it's in the list")
else:
    print("No, It's not in the list.")

2. sort the list
-sort a list of numbers and print it in ascending order.
numbers = [4, 2, 9, 6, 5, 1,]
numbers.sort()
print("Sorted list: ", numbers)

3. reverse the list
-reverse a list and print it.

colors = ["red", "green", "Blue", "Yellow"]
colors.reverse()
print("Reversed list: ", colors)

4. copy a list
-make a copy of your movie list and modify the copy without affecting the original
movies = ["The Shawshank Redemption", "The Godfather", "The Dark Knight"]
movies_copy = movies.copy()
print("Original: ", movies)
print("Copy: ", movies_copy)

5. Nested lists
create a list of 3 students, where each student is represented as a list with a name and age.
students = [["John", 20], ["Mary", 22], ["David", 21]]
print("Student 1 name:", students[0][0])
print("Student 2 age:", students[1][1])

6. Even number extractor
take a list of numbers and create a new list with only the even numbers.

nums = [1, 2,3 ,4 ,5 ,6]
even_nums = []
for num in nums:
    if nums % 2 == 0:
        even_nums.append(num)

print ("Even numbers:", even_nums)

7. Count specific item
count how many times "apple" appears in the list.

fruit_basket = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange","apple"]
print("Apple count:", fruit_basket.count("apple"))

8. List from user
take 3 inputs form the user and create a list.

items = []
for i in range(3):
    val = input(f"Enter tiem {i+1}: ")
    item.append(val)
print("your list:", items)

9. Remove Duplicates
given a list with Duplicates, create a new list without Duplicates

nums = [1,2,3,2,3,5,3,54]
nums.sort()
unique_nums = []

for num in nums:
    if num not in unique_nums:
        unique_nums.append(num)
print("WIthout Duplicates:", unique_nums)

10. Merge two lists
merge two lists into one

a = [1,2,3]
b = [4,5,6]
merge = a + b
print("Merged list:", merge)

challenge of the day: student grades
task:
ask the user for names and scores of 3 students.
store them in a nested list.
then print all students with their scores, and the average score.
